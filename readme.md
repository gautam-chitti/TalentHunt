# **TalentHunt AI Hiring Assistant**

## **1\. Project Overview**

This project is an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot developed for the fictional recruitment agency "TalentHunt". The application serves as a comprehensive initial screening tool that interacts with candidates to gather essential profile information, conducts a preliminary technical assessment using a Large Language Model (LLM), and securely stores the data for administrator review.

The system features a dual-interface design: a conversational AI for candidates and a secure dashboard for administrators to view and manage submissions. This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the PG-AGI AI/ML Intern Assignment.

## **2\. Architecture and Features**

The application is a multi-page Streamlit web app with role-based access control.

### **Key Features:**

- **User Portal:** A main landing page that directs users to either the candidate screening test or an administrator login form.
- **Candidate Screening Chatbot:**
  - A conversational interface that guides candidates through a structured information-gathering process.
  - Dynamically generates tailored technical questions based on the candidate's declared tech stack using a local LLM (Ollama with Llama 3).
  - Collects answers and concludes the session gracefully.
- **Secure Admin Dashboard:**
  - A password-protected page accessible only to administrators.
  - Displays all candidate submissions in a clean, tabular format.
  - **Hardcoded Credentials:** For this assignment, administrator access is granted using the following hardcoded credentials:
    - **Email:** admin@talenthunt.com
    - **Password:** admin123
- **Persistent Data Storage:**
  - All candidate data is stored in a local SQLite database (candidates.db), ensuring data persistence between sessions.
- **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:**
  - As a bonus feature, the application uses the LLM to perform a brief sentiment and confidence analysis on the candidate's technical answers, providing recruiters with an at-a-glance impression.

## **4\. Database Schema**

The application uses a single table named candidates within the candidates.db SQLite database file.

| Column Name        | Data Type | Description                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id                 | INTEGER   | Primary Key, Auto-incrementing.                                               |
| full_name          | TEXT      | Candidate's full name.                                                        |
| email              | TEXT      | Candidate's email address.                                                    |

| years_experience   | TEXT      | Candidate's stated years of professional experience.                          |
| desired_positions  | TEXT      | The role(s) the candidate is interested in.                                   |
| location           | TEXT      | Candidate's current location.                                                 |
| tech_stack         | TEXT      | A string listing the candidate's technical skills.                            |
| technical_answers  | TEXT      | A JSON string containing the generated questions and the candidate's answers. |
| sentiment_analysis | TEXT      | The one-sentence summary generated by the LLM based on the answers.           |
| submission_time    | TEXT      | The UTC timestamp (ISO format) when the record was created.                   |

## **5\. Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautam-chitti/TalentHunt

## **6\. Usage Guide**

1. Ensure the Ollama application is running in the background.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
3. Run the main Streamlit application:  
   streamlit run app.py

4. The application will open in your web browser.
   - **As a Candidate:** Click the "Candidate" button to start the screening test and interact with the chatbot.
   - **As an Administrator:** Use the "Administrator (Sign In)" expander on the main page and enter the hardcoded credentials to log in. Once logged in, the "Admin Dashboard" will become accessible in the sidebar.

## **7\. Prompt Design**

Two primary prompts were engineered to interact with the LLM for specific tasks.

### **Prompt 1: Technical Question Generation**

This prompt is designed to be strict and direct to ensure a clean, machine-parsable output.

Generate exactly 4 concise and relevant technical questions for a candidate with this tech stack: {tech_stack}.  
IMPORTANT: Your response must begin immediately with "1." and contain nothing but the numbered list of questions. Do not add any introductory text.

- **Objective:** To get a list of relevant technical questions.
- **Strategy:** The prompt explicitly forbids conversational filler ("Here are some questions...") and enforces a strict numbered list format. This makes the LLM's output reliable and easy for the Python script to parse.

### **Prompt 2: Sentiment Analysis**

This prompt assigns a persona to the LLM and asks for a qualitative judgment.

As a senior hiring manager, analyze the following technical answers for sentiment and confidence.  
Candidate's Answers:  
{answers_text}  
\---  
Provide a brief, one-sentence summary (e.g., "Candidate appears confident and knowledgeable," or "Candidate seems hesitant but provides logical answers.").

- **Objective:** To get a quick, high-level assessment of the candidate's tone.
- **Strategy:** By instructing the LLM to act "As a senior hiring manager," we frame the task in a professional context. The request for a "brief, one-sentence summary" prevents verbose responses and provides a concise insight for the real-world recruiter.

## **8\. Challenges and Solutions**

- **Challenge:** Ensuring reliable output from the LLM for question generation.
  - **Solution:** The initial LLM responses included conversational preambles that broke the parsing logic. This was solved by engineering a stricter prompt that explicitly forbids introductory text and by implementing more robust parsing code in Python that actively seeks out numbered lines, ignoring any other text.
- **Challenge:** Managing user state and conversation flow in Streamlit.
  - **Solution:** Streamlit's session_state was used extensively to track the user's progress. A "stage" variable (gathering_info, answering_questions, finished) was implemented to create a state machine, ensuring the application always knows what step of the process it is on and what to do next.
- **Challenge:** Implementing role-based access without a full authentication framework.
  - **Solution:** For this assignment's scope, a simple and effective solution was implemented using session_state. A boolean flag (admin_logged_in) is set upon successful entry of hardcoded credentials. The Admin Dashboard page checks for this flag at the very start; if it's not true, the page execution is halted with an error message. CSS is used to conditionally hide the page link from the sidebar for non-logged-in users.
